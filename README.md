# Authentication App

This is a demonstration on how authentication system works.

I have used Ruby on Rails with Bootstrap 5 to build up the webpages.

## Usage:

Click on the link [Authentication App](https://auth-app-ahart.herokuapp.com/) to access the Website.

### Sign Up
1. Click on `Sign Up` or `Sign Up Now!`.
3. Fill up your e-mail and password correctly, then click on `Sign up`.
4. Check your e-mail inbox and follow instructions.
- After you click the link, you're going to be redirected to the website's login page.

### Login
1. Click on `Login`.
2. Fill up with your e-mail and password, then click on `Login`.

### Forgot your Password?
1. Click on `Login`.
2. Click on `Forgot your Password?`
3. Fill up your e-mail.

### Change Password
1. Click on your email on the top-right side of your viewport and select
`Change Password`.
2. Fill up all fields and click on `Update password`.

### Logout
1. Click on `Logout` on the top-right side of your viewport.

### Delete Account
1. Click on your email on the top-right side of your viewport and select
`Delete Account`.
2. You're going to be prompted with an `Are you sure?` message.
3. Click on `OK`.

## Nice to Know

- Validations are held and you're going to be alerted.
- You must confirm your e-mail to be able to log in.
- Both `sign in` and `forgot your password?` e-mails lasts for 15 minutes.
